2018 Google Hash Map contest simple Matlab solution

A friend told me about the google hash map contest with self driving cars. Unfortunately I did not have to opportunity to attend the actual contest, but the problem looked quite interesting so I made a simple solution in Matlab, which is less than 80 lines of code.

The heuristic is quite simple, just dividing the number of points with the total duration for the driving assignment. Still the total number of points is 48016258, but that could probably be improved by making the algorithm more advanced.
